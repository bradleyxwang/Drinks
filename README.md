# Drinks

This is a full-stack web application that uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to allow users to search for and review drinks. The frontend uses React.js components to display drinks from a 3rd party API called TheCocktailDB. The backend uses Node.js and MongoDB to store user reviews for drinks.
